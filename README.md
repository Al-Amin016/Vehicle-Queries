# SQL Queries & Database Design Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of SQL queries on a relational database system. It includes creating and managing tables,
running queries efficiently, and understanding table relationships. The project comes with:

- **queries.sql** – Contains all queries with solutions.
- ** ERD – Visual** representation of the database schema and relationships.
- ** Viva Video** – Explanation of queries and database design.

# How the Queries Work
The queries.sql file contains all SQL queries used in this project. Each query is written to solve a specific requirement:
Data Retrieval : SELECT statements are used to fetch data from tables based on conditions.
Data Manipulation : INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries manage the data in the tables.
Table Relationships : JOIN queries demonstrate how data from multiple tables can be combined.
Aggregation & Filtering : GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions summarize and filter data.
Constraints & Integrity : Primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints maintain data accuracy and consistency.
